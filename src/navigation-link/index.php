<?php
// navigation link needs mulitple styles
// one style should change the sub menu to like a sub tree view
// attribute toggle to allow for changing the url to a hashed url when you open a sub menu so a visitor can share that pre-opened.
// ability to set a icon which would hide the label and show the icon instead.
// A new sub  block or ability for navigation links to also have an expand button, i guess this is similair to sub tree view but styled slightly different.
